Beautiful like an aurora! A simple WordPress heatmap that can be completed with just a plugin.

== Description ==

Goddess Aurora is said to give light to the user world.
The name "Aurora Heatmap" visualizes user behavior with a beautiful heatmap.
Bringing light to the activation and optimization of your website.

= The most important thing in site management. =

That is, *Is the user satisfied?*

* Where do users see and move through the content?
* Whether the user is not confused?

Aurora Heatmap is the **strongest tool** for visualizing it.

1. Are you guiding users well?
2. Conversion rate
3. Are you missing out on prospects and readers?
4. How is it evaluated by Google?

You will be able to see the points of improvement.

= Plugin features =

***No Coding***
***No Setting***

You just install and activate the plugin.
No troublesome user registration or setup is required.
It works as default in most WordPress environments.
And Aurora Heatmap is **complete with just plugin**.

The free version can check the click heat map of PC and mobile, and can be used on any number of sites.
Even if it is free, there is no limit due to the number of PV and analysis pages.

= Special notes =

If it does not work well when used with a cache plugin, turn off JavaScript-related optimization, or exclude jQuery and Aurora Heatmap measurement script (reporter.js) from optimization.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is account registration or contract required to use Heatmap?

Unlike many heatmap services, Aurora Heatmap works completely within your WordPress.
No account registration or contract is required.
However, a monthly or annual license agreement is required to use the premium version.

= Is there a limit to the number of pages or PV that can be analyzed? =

There are no restrictions on the paid version or the free version.

= When viewing a mobile heatmap from a PC, the PC page is displayed. =

If you switch using User-Agent instead of responsive design, view the heatmap from your mobile.

= Which should be used for accuracy setting? =

The recommendation is *high accuracy*, which selects the data to be recorded for an accurate heatmap.
If the recording is not enough, try *Standard*.

Please note the following points when changing the accuracy setting.

1. High accuracy - the previous standard data will be deleted.
2. Standard - from that point, recording of standard data begins.

= How long can I see the heatmap after installing the plugin? =

Depending on the number of visits to the site, data will accumulate in a few hours to two days.

= Is the heat map displayed in real time? =

User behavior is recorded via Ajax communication as often as necessary.
The recorded data will be displayed on the screen after reloading.

= About 3 days have passed, but there seems to be no data. =

Counting may not occur for sites with extremely low access.
Make sure that there is an inflow to the site.
Also, if you are using a cache plugin, the analysis script may not be output on the page, so delete the cache once.

= It is not counted even if you access it yourself. =

In order to ensure the reliability of the analysis data, the data to be acquired with a specific algorithm is selected.
Administrator access is also excluded.

= There should be access to various pages, but only the top page is recorded. =

In case of default permalink ( `?p=123` format ), it will be a parameter format URL.
If the URL parameter of the setting is integration, it will be regarded as the top page, so please set it to individual display.

= It seems that the number of records recorded in the heatmap is smaller than the number of accesses. =

The purpose of heatmaps is not to count absolute numbers, but to understand trends in user behavior.
In order to improve the reliability of data, the data to be recorded is selected with a specific algorithm.
The number of records is also affected by the accuracy setting.

= If the permalink is changed, will the heatmap data be inherited? =

In the current specification, the heatmap data is stored in association with the URL, so if you change the URL by changing the permalink or post slug, it will be treated as a separate page.

= Can I see a heatmap on my smartphone? =

From 1.0.2, it is now possible to check from the dashboard on a mobile device.

= What is a count bar? =

It shows how many data are recorded at which position on the vertical axis.
Should help with behavior analysis.

= Will the recorded data not leak to the outside? =

In both the free version and paid version, there is no transmission of heat map data to external servers.
